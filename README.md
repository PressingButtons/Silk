# Silk
Javascript Fighting Game Editor

Silk is the front end interface for the ArachnidJS engine. This is geared to making fighting games in javascript. May be branched out later to include other genres but for now, the scope is to focus on fighting games. In particular platform fighters. The system will use ArachnidJS tile based collision detection. This will allow for fighters to have platform based collisions or have a more traditional movement layout
